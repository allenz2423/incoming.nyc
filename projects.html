            <h1 class="project-title">American Sign Language (ASL) Translating Gloves</h1>
            <a class="project-text">On June 15th, 2022, I was on my commute home from Manhattan. The commute wasn't pleasant because my earbuds died. Out of the corner of my eyes, I noticed a couple of deaf people talking. They seemed pretty angry, but because I didn't understand sign language, I was unable to understand what they were saying. That gave me the idea to create sign language translating gloves.</a>
            <br><a class="project-text">By using machine learning, I am able to translate some basic hand words/phrases. While (and still currently) creating this glove, I had to learn a couple new tools/technologies. I had to learn how to write C++ for Arduinos, use TensorFlow and scikit-learn, basic machine learning principles, basic Arduino wiring, HTTP methods, Flask (for basic HTTP server), reading wiring diagrams, and soldering safety. As you can clearly see, I am pretty bad at soldering, and managing the mess.</a>

            <a class="project-text">This was a class project. We were tasked with creating a copycat website of our choice. The idea is, if we create a copycat of another website, we will solidify our HTML and CSS skills even further.</a>
